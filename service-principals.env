# Service Principal for deploying a model as webservice
# notes: - you can also set the values via environment variables if storing them in a file is no good option for you/your solution.
#        - the values defined here are only used to store them in the keyvault of the used AzureML Workspace.
#          changing values here or in the environment variable won't take effect once the base/01_setup/azureml/setup.py
#          script has been run. if you need to change the values afterwards, you have to change them in the keyvault
#          via AzureML. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-secrets-in-runs for details.
#          short version is:
#               keyvault = (your workspace object).get_default_keyvault()
#               keyvault.set_secret(name="<variable name>", value = "<variable value>")
#
#          alternatively, re-running the setup.py script might work (please check code before)
